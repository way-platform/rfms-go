        The vehicle position resource is used to get the positions for one or several vehicles.
        The starttime, stoptime & latestOnly parameters can be used to get all historical
        positions between a start and stop time or the latest known position only.
        The vin parameter can be used to get all historical positions between starttime and
        stoptime or latest position for one individual vehicle.
        If the vin parameter isn't set the response will contain all vehicles the client
        has access to.
        If a request is made for data in a period where no data has been received, an empty

        The max number of items returned in one call is OEM specific.

        It is mandatory to either supply the starttime (for historical requests) or latestOnly
        (for getting the latest data). If none of these parameters are set, a HTTP 400 error
        will be returned indicating that the parameters supplied are invalid.

        If latestOnly and starttime and/or stoptime are set, a HTTP 400 error will be returned
        indicating that the parameters supplied are invalid.

        If the moreDataAvailable is set to true in the response and the latestOnly was set to
        true in the request then the next request shall state the last received VIN to get the
        full set. The vehicles are always returned in the same order, when using latestOnly.
        The ordering is OEM specific.
        Otherwise use the last ReceivedDateTime + 1 second of the last vehicle from the last
        response using it as the starttime parameter in the next request.
