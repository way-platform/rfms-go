# Security Policy

Way welcomes feedback from security researchers and the general public to help
improve our security. If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability,
privacy issue, exposed data, or other security issues in relation to this
project, we want to hear from you. This policy outlines steps for reporting
security issues to us, what we expect, and what you can expect from us.

## Supported versions

We release patches for security issues according to semantic versioning. This
project is currently unstable (v0.x) and only the latest version will receive
security patches.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues,
discussions, or change requests.

Please report security issues via email to
[oss-security@wayplatform.com](mailto:oss-security@wayplatform.com). Provide all
relevant information, including steps to reproduce the issue, any affected
versions, and known mitigations. The more details you provide, the easier it
will be for us to triage and fix the issue. You will receive a response from us
within 2 business days. If the issue is confirmed, a patch will be released as
soon as possible.

## Preferred languages

English is our preferred language of communication.

## Contributions and recognition

We appreciate every contribution and will do our best to publicly acknowledge
your contributions.
